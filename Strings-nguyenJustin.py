oldEssay = "Artificial intelligence has had cases of harmful uses such as the exploitive \“deep fakes\” that have portrayed students at a New Jersey High School in a sexual manner without requiring any notification (Chan and Tenbarge). On the other hand, it can also be observed that this human invention has also been utilized in ways that can aid humanity such as the enhancement of cancer detection in symptomatic individuals (Jaber). These are uses of artificial intelligence in areas in which the accidents of the work may involve creativity, especially in the medical field example of the latter in which creativity is not negotiable and undoubtedly necessary (Amiri et al.), but in their substantial nature are not necessarily geared toward the production of new works as an end (Kim and Lee), with the continued medical example of health care workers frequent need for creative solutions to problems being ordered toward service of patience and clients in health-related matters (Amiri et al.; Kim and Lee). The concept of artificial intelligence in these fields as a means of progress can be argued for or against in these fields where the nature of creativity is not the main end of the occupation. However, when it comes to the field of creative arts, whether that is visual, literary, or performance, the usage of artificial intelligence should be avoided as a primary medium for artwork - the components contributing to this being the lack of cognitive exercise, the devaluation of genuine human labor as the value of the final product generated by the artificial intelligence is given more emphasis and the loss of individuality of persons that results from the generations of artificial intelligence. First, however, we must consider an argument in defense of artificial intelligence use in the arts, pointing out that it provides opportunities for people to have a place in the production of artificially generated products. The ease at which people use the program may be cited as proof of empowerment of people (Boehman; Filimowicz). While it may be conceded that the usage of artificial intelligence in the field of the arts may have enabled people to produce works that have some degree of reflecting their original ideas when they have not yet possessed art skills to bring their ideas to fruition, genuine empowerment is ideally achieved when people learn to utilize their own unique experience and skillset and incorporate these irreplaceable characteristics, even unconsciously or implicitly, into the artwork. With that argument of how artificial intelligence in the field of art production might be potentially beneficial addressed, we can now consider the losses and compromises to the nature of creative labor. We can first argue that the work done by artificial intelligence, though admittedly may not entirely eliminate the need for human reason as many artificial intelligence programs require a prompt, relaxes the process of developing oneself in mental development in the field of the art involved. We can take the classic example of the London taxi driver study, which found that taxi drivers in London have greater gray matter in the hippocampus (Maguire et al.; Griesbauer et al.), which is responsible for learning and memory, than bus drivers and that the amount of gray matter increases with experience even among taxi drivers (Maguire et al.). In a more recent study on musical practice and its effect on the brain, a correlation between neuroplasticity, defined as the \“process of structural and functional brain adaptation to achieve new skills in response to internal and external stimuli\” in the report, and practice in the field of music (Olszewska et al.). Although music is just one form of art, these two studies examined together can highlight a common idea that brain development can correlate, without claiming full causation, strongly with practice. That point being made we can see that the usage of artificial intelligence in the arts takes away from this repeated practice, preventing or at the very least hindering genuine development in an authentic practice of these arts. By taking this factor away, artificial intelligence is compromising a highly important aspect of art production. Along with this detriment to the field of the arts, reliance on artificial intelligence as an idealized means of creation can also be detrimental to the sociality of the inherent value of human art. Consider the case of artist Eva Toorenent, who has had her style plagiarized by another person who ended up selling their newly generated products (Carter). Although I do not know their intentions in this specific case, without immediately condemning the other person as a human being, I wholeheartedly can empathize with her. The reduction of art, especially in the realm of visual arts in which generative artificial intelligence has been prevalent, to its mere finished product and acknowledgment of its final style without realizing the sacrifices that the individual artist had to make is profoundly dehumanizing. It is this reduction of art into results that artificial intelligence promotes as the process of creating is simplified to prompts, with its most arduous which I do acknowledge involving levels of revision and editing (Shadiversity). However, to ensure that people are truly empowered in their endeavors of creative labor, blurring the line between human art and algorithmic generations is to be prevented by avoiding the use of artificial intelligence in the production of art. Lastly, the last point on why artificial intelligence should be avoided in the process of art is that this application of the application homogenizes the work of art, perpetuating a depersonalization of the pieces churned out by generative artificial intelligence. This is not only because the data relied on in order to train these algorithms includes copyrighted material from other people (Glover), but also because of the lack of a unique identity that this synthesis of multiple individuals’ ideas has. Art gets its value from the person who produces it and contributes their own unique experience and humanity to the work. Taking the example of the art of literature, words are not merely challenges of chance where words with a degree of similarity and fittingness are next to each other in a specific context, which text-based generative artificial intelligence does (Trott). Instead, it becomes an art form, in which creative ways of expression are formulated in ways that have profound depth and resonance. The writer makes use not of simply connecting words that seem appropriate for the situation on a practical level, but understands that there is an optional beauty in playing with these words beyond what is merely necessary toward a systematic goal. The human person can take these liberties in the creative process to make a work that genuinely reflects them as a person. Artificial intelligence in these areas as it generates its works lacks this ability and therefore should not be a primary form of producing authentic art. Now, although I wrote this essay giving specific examples of sections of the arts such as music, visual, and literary, and it is absurd that I would try to blend the beauty of each of these unique arts into one simplified definition of art, they all have components essential to their nature as creative labor. As argued in this essay, the disempowerment of humanity to develop themselves as human beings, the dehumanization of creative labor as it is portrayed in light only of the ends achieved through it, and the lack of personality all too persistent in the program are reasons to avoid utilizing artificial intelligence in creative work."
